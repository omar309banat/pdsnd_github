# Bike Share Data Exploration

## Overview

In this project, you will make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. 

You will write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. Additionally, you will create a script that takes in raw input to provide an interactive experience in the terminal, presenting these statistics to the user.

Bike Share Data Exploration

## Description
### Bike Share Data

Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.

Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.

In this project, you will use data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. You will compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

## Features
- Data import and cleaning
- Descriptive statistics computation
- Interactive terminal experience

## Files Used
To answer the questions using Python, you will need to write a Python script. A template with helper code and comments is provided in the `bikeshare.py` file, where you will do your scripting. You will also need the three city dataset files:

- `chicago.csv`
- `new_york_city.csv`
- `washington.csv`

All four of these files are zipped up in the "all_project_files" document in the Resources tab in the sidebar on the left side of this page. (You may need to scroll down inside the Resources tab to see the "all_project_files" doc.) You can choose to download and unzip that "all_project_files" doc to access all four project files and do your project work on your local machine.

If you'd prefer, the later Project Workspace page in the classroom also has the `bikeshare.py` file and all the city dataset files included in it, and you can do all your work on the project with them there. If you choose this option, you don't need to download the files from the Resources tab.
